# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualiser

A terminal program that visualises 4 sorting algorithms:

1) Insertion Sort
2) Heap Sort
3) Merge Sort
4) Quick Sort
  
To run the program: $java TerminalUI (inside /bin)

The most notable/novel part of this repository is the "binary tree visualiser" - a simple and effective way to display trees inside of the terminal. Methods associated with this are located inside "HeapSort.java".
